CHAPTER 1: AN OVERVIEW OF THE INTERNET AND THE WEB

#Short Questions
Qns1:Define the term ”Protocol” in the context of the Internet.
->a protocol is a set of rules and standards that define how data is formatted, transmitted, received, and interpreted between devices on a network in the context of internet.

qns2:What is the primary difference between a Web Browser and a Search Engine?
->The primary difference between a web browser and a search engine are:.

  A web browser is a software application used to access, retrieve, and display web pages on the internet. It allows users to visit websites by entering a URL and view content such as text, images, and videos.
  Examples: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari

  A search engine is an online service or website that helps users find information on the internet by searching for keywords. It lists relevant websites based on the user’s query.
  Examples: Google Search, Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo

qns3:Define the World Wide Web (WWW).
->The World Wide Web (WWW) is a global system of interlinked web pages and resources that are accessed over the Internet using a web browser. It uses hypertext links to connect documents, allowing users to easily navigate from one page to another.

qns4:Distinguish between a static web page and a dynamic web page.
->the distinction between a static web page and a dynamic web page are:
  
  A static web page displays fixed content.Content is the same for all users.Created using HTML and CSS only.No real-time updates.

  A dynamic web page displays content that changes.Content can vary for different users.Uses server-side languages like PHP, Node.js, Python, or Java, along with databases.Supports real-time updates and user interaction.

#Long Questions
qns5:Explain the client-server architecture of the web with a neat diagram.
->The client–server architecture is a model where the client (user’s device) requests services or resources, and the server provides them. In the web, this architecture enables users to access websites and web applications efficiently.

Explanation:

The Client is usually a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) running on a user’s device.

The client sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to the server (for example, when a URL is entered).

The Web Server processes the request. If required, it communicates with a Database Server to fetch or store data.

The server then sends an HTTP response (HTML, CSS, images, data, etc.) back to the client.

The client’s browser displays the received content to the user.

+---------+        HTTP Request        +-------------+
| Client  |  ---------------------->  |  Web Server |
| (Browser)|                           |             |
+---------+        HTTP Response       +-------------+
        <----------------------        |
                                       |
                                       v
                                +--------------+
                                |   Database   |
                                |    Server    |
                                +--------------+


qns6:Describe the functions of the following Internet services: Email, FTP, and VoIP.
->1. Email (Electronic Mail)
    -Email is a service used to send and receive digital messages over the Internet.
    -Allows instant communication worldwide
    -Supports text messages, attachments (documents, images, videos)
    -Used for formal and informal communication
    -Example: Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo Mail
  
  2. FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
    -FTP is a service used to upload and download files between a client and a server.
    -Enables large file transfer efficiently
    -Commonly used for website file management
    -Supports file sharing and backup
    -Example: FileZilla, WinSCP

  3. VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)
    -VoIP allows users to make voice and video calls over the Internet instead of traditional phone lines.
    -Converts voice signals into digital data
    -Supports audio and video communication
    -Reduces calling cost, especially for international calls
    -Example: WhatsApp, Skype, Zoom

qns7:”The Internet is a network of networks.” Elaborate on this statement explaining how packet switching works.
->The Internet is called a network of networks because it is not a single network owned or controlled by one organization. Instead, 
it is made up of millions of smaller networks (such as home networks, school networks, office LANs, ISPs, and national backbone networks) 
that are interconnected globally using standard protocols like TCP/IP. These independent networks communicate with each other to allow 
data to travel from any device to any other device in the world.

How Packet Switching Works:

Packet switching is the technique used by the Internet to transmit data efficiently.

-Data Division:
 When data (such as an email, web page, or video) is sent, it is broken into small units called packets.

-Packet Header:
 Each packet contains a header with important information like source address, destination address, packet number, and error-checking data.

-Independent Routing:
 Packets travel independently through different routes across multiple networks and routers, depending on traffic and availability.

-Network of Routers:
 Routers in different networks forward packets toward their destination, forming a path across this network of networks.

-Reassembly:
 At the destination, packets are reassembled in the correct order to recreate the original data.

-Error Handling:
 If packets are lost or damaged, TCP requests retransmission to ensure reliable delivery.

#Scenario-Based Questions 
qns8:A startup company wants to host a website that displays the same information to all
visitors and requires very low maintenance costs. However, they are being advised to use
a dynamic website. As a consultant, would you agree? Justify your answer.
->As a consultant, I would not agree with the advice to use a dynamic website for this startup.

 Justification:
   -The company wants a website that:
   -Displays the same information to all visitors

Requires very low maintenance cost:

These requirements are best satisfied by a static website, not a dynamic one.

A static website consists of fixed web pages created using HTML and CSS, and it does not require a 
database or server-side scripting. Because the content does not change based on users, static pages are 
simple, fast, secure, and inexpensive to host and maintain. Updates are minimal and can be done easily by editing the files.

On the other hand, a dynamic website uses server-side programming and databases to generate content dynamically. 
This increases development complexity, hosting cost, security risks, and maintenance efforts, which is unnecessary
when the content is the same for all users.

qns9:A user types www.google.com into their browser, but the browser displays a ”Server Not
Found” error, even though the internet connection is active. However, accessing the site
via 142.250.190.46 works. Diagnose the problem and explain the underlying technology
that failed.
->Diagnosis of the Problem:
  -The problem is not with the internet connection or the web server, because the website opens successfully when accessed
  using the IP address 142.250.190.46.
  -The issue occurs only when using www.google.com, which indicates a failure in domain name resolution.


Explanation:

  -When a user types www.google.com, the browser does not understand domain names directly.
  -It first contacts a DNS server to translate (resolve) the domain name into its corresponding IP address.
  -In this case, the DNS server failed to resolve www.google.com, so the browser showed a “Server Not Found” error.
  -When the user entered 142.250.190.46 directly, DNS was bypassed, and the browser could connect to Google’s server successfully.

Possible Causes of DNS Failure:
  -DNS server not responding or misconfigured
  -Incorrect DNS settings on the device
  -ISP DNS issues
  -Corrupted DNS cache

qns10:A multinational corporation wants to share sensitive inventory data with specific suppliers
but does not want this information available to the general public. Explain which network
type (Intranet, Extranet, or Internet) they should implement and why.
->The multinational corporation should implement an Extranet.

In this scenario:
  -The data is sensitive inventory information
  -It must be shared with specific suppliers only
  -It should not be accessible to the general public

An Extranet perfectly meets these requirements because it:
  -Extends the company’s Intranet to trusted external parties
  -Uses security measures such as user authentication, encryption, and access control
  -Allows selective data sharing without exposing information on the public Internet
  -Supports collaboration while maintaining confidentiality

Why not the others?
-Internet: Public network; information would be accessible to everyone (not secure)
-Intranet: Restricted to internal employees only; suppliers cannot access it
