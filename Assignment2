Chapter 2: Web Development Process

#Short Questions
qns1:Define the term ”Sitemap” in the planning phase
->A sitemap is a visual or structured representation of a website’s pages and their hierarchy. It is created during the planning phase of web
development to organize and outline the structure of the website before actual design and coding begin.

qns2:What is the purpose of the ”Launch” phase in web development?
->The Launch phase in web development is when the website is made live on the Internet. Its purpose is to publish the site, ensure all
features work correctly, configure hosting and domain, and start monitoring performance.

qns3:Why is ”Documentation” important in the development lifecycle?
->Documentation is important because it records development processes, aids maintenance, helps debugging, and guides future updates.

qns4:Differentiate between Front-end and Back-end development.
->Front-end development deals with the visual part of a website that users interact with (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), while Back-end development 
handles the server, database, and application logic that powers the website behind the scenes (PHP, Node.js, Python).

#Long Answer questions
qns5:”Planning is the most critical phase of web development.” Discuss this statement by listing
the key activities performed during the planning phase.
->Planning is the most critical phase because it lays the foundation for the entire website. Proper planning ensures the website meets user
requirements, is well-structured, and avoids costly errors later in development.

Key Activities in the Planning Phase:
  -Requirement Analysis: Identify the purpose, target audience, and goals of the website.
  -Content Planning: Decide what information, text, images, and media will be included.
  -Sitemap Creation: Outline the structure and hierarchy of web pages.
  -Technology Selection: Choose appropriate tools, platforms, and frameworks.
  -Project Timeline: Plan the schedule, resources, and milestones.

qns6:Explain the iterative nature of the Maintenance phase. Why is a website never truly
”finished”?
->Explanation:
  -After launch, a website may need content updates, bug fixes, or security patches.
  -User feedback and analytics may suggest changes to improve usability or performance.
  -New technologies or browser updates may require the website to be modified to remain compatible.
  -This creates a cycle of continuous monitoring, updating, and testing, which is why it is iterative.

Why a Website is Never Truly “Finished”:
  -The web is dynamic, with constantly changing user needs and technology.
  -Security threats, browser updates, and new devices require ongoing maintenance.
  -Content and design need to evolve to stay relevant and effective.

qns7:Describe the process of ”Information Gathering.” Why is understanding the target audience crucial during this step?
->Information Gathering is the process of collecting all necessary data and requirements before designing and developing a website. 
This step ensures that the website meets the client’s objectives and user needs.

Understanding the Target Audience is Crucial beasuce of followimg points:
  -Relevance & Resonance: You create messages and products that speak directly to their needs, interests, and desires, increasing engagement.
  -Optimized Resources: It prevents wasted effort and budget by focusing on the most promising potential customers, maximizing ROI.
  -Informed Decision-Making: You understand their motivations, pain points, and preferences, guiding better product development and strategy.
  -Effective Communication: Knowing their preferred channels and language ensures your message is seen and understood, fostering connection.
  -Tailored Solutions: You can customize offerings and solutions to provide real value, rather than generic features.
  -Builds Relationships: Listening to and understanding your audience helps build trust and long-term loyalty. 

#scenario based Questions
qns8:You are the project manager for a new e-commerce site. The client wants to skip the
”Testing” phase to save money and launch early. Write a persuasive argument explaining
the potential risks (security, functionality, compatibility) of skipping this phase. 6 marks
->Persuasive Argument: Importance of the Testing Phase

As the project manager, I strongly advise against skipping the Testing phase. While skipping it may save money initially, 
it exposes the website to serious risks that can harm the business, reputation, and revenue.

1. Security Risks
  -E-commerce websites handle sensitive customer data like credit card details and personal information.
  -Without testing, vulnerabilities may go unnoticed, leaving the site open to hacking, data theft, or malware attacks.
  -A security breach can damage customer trust and lead to legal consequences.

2. Functionality Risks
  -Testing ensures that all features work correctly, including product search, shopping cart, payment gateway, and order processing.
  -Skipping testing can result in broken links, failed transactions, or incorrect calculations, frustrating customers and causing lost sales.

3. Compatibility Risks
  -Users access websites on different devices, browsers, and screen sizes.
  -Without testing, the site may not display or function properly on some browsers or mobile devices, leading to a poor user experience.

4. Financial and Reputational Costs
  -Fixing issues after launch is more expensive and time-consuming than during testing.
  -Negative user experiences or security breaches can damage the brand’s reputation permanently.

qns9:A developer begins coding a website immediately after meeting the client, without creating
a design prototype or sitemap. Midway through, the client rejects the layout. Analyze
what went wrong in the process and how it should have been handled.
->The developer made a critical process mistake by skipping the planning and design phase. Key issues:

No Design Prototype:
  -The client had no visual representation of the website before coding began.
  -Without approval, the developer assumed the layout would meet client expectations, leading to misalignment.

No Sitemap or Planning:
  -The website structure and navigation were not clearly defined.
  -This caused confusion in content placement and flow, making redesign necessary midway.

Coding Before Approval:
  -Writing code before finalizing the design wastes time and resources.
  -Changes requested by the client require rework, increasing project cost and delay

How It Should Have Been Handled
  -Requirement Analysis: Understand client goals and target audience.
  -Create Sitemap: Define all pages and navigation structure.
  -Design Prototype / Mockup: Show a visual representation of layout and features.
  -Client Approval: Only begin coding after the client reviews and approves the design.
  -Iterative Feedback: Use revisions on the prototype to avoid major changes during development.

qns10:A university website was launched successfully, but after six months, students stopped
visiting it because the exam schedules were outdated. Which phase of the development
lifecycle was neglected? Explain the activities involved in this phase. 6 marks
->The problem occurred because the website was not updated after launch, indicating that the Maintenance phase of the development lifecycle was neglected.

Explanation:
  -The Maintenance phase is an ongoing phase where the website is monitored, updated, and improved to ensure it remains accurate, functional, and relevant.

Activities Involved in the Maintenance Phase:
  -Content Updates: Keeping information like exam schedules, notices, and news current.
  -Bug Fixes: Identifying and correcting errors or broken links.
  -Security Updates: Applying patches and updates to protect the site from threats.
  -Performance Monitoring: Ensuring fast loading times and smooth operation.
  -Compatibility Updates: Updating the site to work with new browsers or devices.
  -User Feedback Implementation: Making improvements based on student or staff suggestions.
